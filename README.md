# Stock-Market-Prediction-Project

In this project, stock market prediction based on historical data of companies has been done by one of the machine learning methods called LSTM. One of the most crucial parts of a machine learning algorithm is updating weights and biases between nodes in a neural network. This operation is done by some calculations on loss functions. Loss functions are basically used for estimating error between observed value and desired value in dataset. To make updates on weights and biases optimizers have been developed such as gradient descent, adam, adagrad. What is the most efficient optimizer and loss function to use while predicting market value ? This question has been investigated.
